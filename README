OpenEmbedded BSP layer for Rockchip boards

About:
-----
	The purpose of this layer is to provide OpenEmbedded BSP support for
	Rockchip-based devices using upstream sources as much as possible.

Dependencies:
------------
	URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
	layers: meta
	branch: matched branches (e.g. master, sumo, ...)

	URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-arm
	layers: meta-arm, meta-arm-toolchain
	branch: matched branches (e.g. master, sumo, ...)

Status of supported boards:
--------------------------
	builds and boots wic image:
		nanopi-m4
		nanopi-m4-2gb

		rock-pi-4a
		rock-pi-4b
		rock-pi-4c
		rock64
		tinker-board
		tinker-board-s

		rock-4c-plus
	builds:
		marsboard-rk3066
		radxarock
		rock2-square

Notes:
-----
	The latest ddr initializer for the rk3308 platform does not output
	diagnostic messages to uart0. This causes a bunch of gibberish to
	be printed to the console window which only becomes legible once
	the linux kernel starts. I.e. the console output of the ddr
	initialization routine, as well as u-boot is lost. An older
	version of this same binary blob does, however, support output to
	uart0 (making its diagnostic messages as well as u-boot available
	on the console). By default the build assumes the user would like
	to see these message and be able to have the option to interact
	with u-boot.

	IOW: for rk3308-based devices, an older version of rkbin is used.

	If, however, the user would prefer to use the latest binary ddr
	initializer from rkbin, simply set:

		RKBIN_RK3308_LATEST = "1"
	
	in the configuration (e.g. conf/local.conf).

U-Boot Environment:
------------------
	In order to configure U-Boot to be able to store its environment into the
	device from which it was booted, for any device supported in this BSP,
	simply add the following to MACHINE_FEATURES:

		rk-u-boot-env

	If enabled, to additionally have the U-Boot environment generated and
	stored in the image, also enable the following variable (default: off):

		RK_IMAGE_INCLUDES_UBOOT_ENV

	The script:

		scripts/dump-uboot-env-from-yocto-image.sh

	can be used on a rockchip wic image to see the contents of the U-Boot
	environment partition at build time.

Maintenance:
-----------
	Please send pull requests, patches, comments, or questions to the
	yocto-patches mailing list (yocto-patches@lists.yoctoproject.org)
	CCing the maintainer

	When sending patches, please make sure the email subject line includes
	"[meta-rockchip][PATCH]" and follow the community's patch submission
	guidelines, as described in:
		https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Commit_Patch_Message_Guidelines
		https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded

	This can be configured within the repository with the following commands:

		git config sendemail.to yocto-patches@lists.yoctoproject.org
		git config sendemail.cc <your full email address>
		git config format.subjectprefix "meta-rockchip] [PATCH"

	Then, to send your most recent commit (i.e. just one patch),
	please use something like:

		git format-patch -M -1
		git send-email <your patch file>
